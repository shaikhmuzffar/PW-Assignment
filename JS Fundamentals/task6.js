
//  Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript is crucial for code readability and maintenance.
//  Clear identifiers enhance understanding, reduce ambiguity, and make it easier for developers (including yourself) to grasp the purpose and functionality of the code.

// Poor variable naming
let x = 10;
let y = 5;
let z = x + y;

// Improved with meaningful variable names
let width = 10;
let height = 5;
let area = width + height;
