task2: Explain the role of the following key properties in the Flexbox layout mode?

1. justify-content
2. align-items
3. gap
4. flex-direction
5. flex-wrap

solution:

1. justify-content: This helps with how stuff spreads out from left to right (or top to bottom). Imagine you have a row of books on a shelf. `justify-content` helps decide if they should all be pushed to one end, spread out evenly, or something in between.

2. align-items: Think of this as arranging the books vertically on the shelf. `align-items` decides if they should be at the top, middle, or bottom of the shelf, or maybe stretch to fill the whole shelf.

3. gap: This is like adding some space between the books on the shelf. It makes sure they're not too squished together. You can set how much space you want between them.

4. flex-direction: Imagine your shelf can be a vertical one (like a tower of books) or a horizontal one (like a row of books). `flex-direction` lets you choose if your books should go up and down (`column`) or left to right (`row`).

5. flex-wrap: Normally, your books try to fit on one shelf without falling off. But if you have too many books, `flex-wrap` lets you decide if they should start a new shelf (like a new row) or just keep squeezing onto the same shelf.
