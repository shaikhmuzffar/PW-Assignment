task2: Explain the purpose of comments in HTML and provide an example of how to use comments in an HTML
document?

solution:

-Comments in HTML serve the purpose of providing non-rendered, human-readable notes within the code.
-They are primarily used to document and explain the code's structure, purpose, or any other relevant information for developers who may read or work with the HTML document. Comments are not displayed on the web page when it's viewed in a web browser; they are purely for internal reference.
