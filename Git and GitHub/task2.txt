Q2. Explain the Git Workflow, including the staging area, working directory, and repository

solution:

Git Workflow:

1.Working Directory: This is the space on your local machine where you create, modify, and organize files for your project. Any changes made in the working directory are initially untracked by Git.

2.Staging Area (Index): The staging area acts as an intermediate step where you prepare and organize your changes before committing them. Using the git add command, you selectively choose which modifications you want to include in the next commit. This allows you to group related changes together, making your commits more logical and structured.

3.Repository: The repository is the database where Git permanently stores snapshots of your project's history. When you're satisfied with the changes in the staging area, you create a commit using git commit. A commit is like a snapshot of your project at that moment in time, and it comes with a commit message that describes the changes made. This history of commits enables you to track the evolution of your project, review previous states, and collaborate with others.

The Git workflow, with its working directory, staging area, and repository, provides a powerful version control system that allows you to work on your project efficiently, maintain an organized history, collaborate with team members, and confidently manage changes to your codebase.
