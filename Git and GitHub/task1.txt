solution:


Version control is a system that tracks and manages changes to code and digital assets. It's vital in software development for:

1.Collaboration: Multiple developers work on the same project simultaneously.

2.Code Backup: Provides a backup of code in case of data loss or issues.

3.Branching: Allows separate lines of development.

4.Code Review: Facilitates code review and quality control.

5.Rollback: Enables reverting to a previous working state.

6.Historical Analysis: Helps understand code evolution and make informed decisions.

Version control is essential for organized, collaborative, and error-resistant software development.
