solution: 

JavaScript has five primitive data types:

1. String:
   - Represents textual data.
   - Example: `let message = "Hello, World!";`

2. Number:
   - Represents numeric data, both integers and floating-point numbers.
   - Example: `let count = 42;`

3. Boolean:
   - Represents a logical entity and has two values: `true` or `false`.
   - Example: `let isDone = false;`

4. Null:
   - Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
   - Example: `let data = null;`

5. Undefined:
   - Represents a declared variable that has not been assigned a value.
   - Example: `let variableWithoutValue;`
