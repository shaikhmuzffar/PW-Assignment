Q1. Explain the role of operators in JavaScript. Why are they essential in programming?

solution:

1.Arithmetic Operations:
- Operators like +, -, *, /, and % perform basic arithmetic, allowing manipulation of numeric data.

2.Assignment Operations:
- The = operator assigns a value to a variable. For example, x = 10; assigns the value 10 to the variable x.
Comparison Operations:

3.Comparison operators
- (==, ===, !=, !==, <, >, <=, >=) compare values and return a Boolean result (true or false), crucial for decision-making in conditional statements.

4.Logical Operations:

- Logical operators (&&, ||, !) perform logical operations, combining or negating Boolean values. They are vital for building complex conditions.

5.Increment and Decrement Operations:
- The ++ and -- operators increment and decrement numeric values, providing a concise way to modify variables.

6.Concatenation Operations:
tas- The + operator can concatenate strings, joining them together.
