            <h2>1. Semantic Elements</h2>
            <p>HTML5 introduced a set of semantic elements like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt; which provide a clear structure to your web page. They make it easier for search engines and screen readers to understand the content and improve the overall accessibility of your website.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Multimedia Support</h2>
            <p>HTML5 includes native support for audio and video playback with the &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; elements. This eliminates the need for third-party plugins like Flash and allows you to embed multimedia content directly into your web pages. It supports various formats and provides better compatibility across browsers.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Form Enhancements</h2>
            <p>HTML5 introduced new form elements and attributes that simplify form validation and user interaction. Features like the &lt;input&gt; types for email, URL, and date, as well as attributes like "required" and "pattern," make it easier to create user-friendly and error-tolerant forms without relying on JavaScript.</p>
